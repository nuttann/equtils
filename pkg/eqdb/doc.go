Package eqdb provides an abstraction to some data related to Everquest (EQ).
The initial data is read directly into memory, but may be changed to use an
actual DB to be more efficient if necessary or to use a network source if
one becomes available.

Items

This holds item attributes extracted from various sources. Currently that is
very limited.
