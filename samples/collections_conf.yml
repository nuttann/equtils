# Sample configuraiton file for the "collectstoweb" command.

# 'questsfile' points to the file containing all the quest info. 
questsfile: /Users/Nuttann/Eq/eqdata/collection_quests.yml

# 'itemdbloc' (Item Database Loc) points to the DB location for reading and
# writing. (The current code supports a YAML file for the database.)
itemdbloc: /Users/Nuttann/Eq/eqdata/itemdb.yml

# 'htmlout' points to where the output should be written.
htmlout: "/Users/Nuttann/Eq/output/collection.html"

# 'htmltitle' will be used in the HTML as both the document title and the
# overall document header. This will be escaped for HTML so using text such as
# an '&' should appear verbatim in the output.
htmltitle: "EQ Collection Items"

# 'htmlintro' data will be inserted betwwen the title and the inventory
# listing. This is treated as raw HTML so external links to other docs such as
# detailed instructions can be added. Any HTML tokens that must appear directly
# in the final intro must be escaped here.
htmlintro: 'Contact Nuttann via in-game email if you want some items from these
houses.  <b>Each mail should list the house address (E.g., which house) along
with up to 10 items to be retrieved from that house.</b> You can send multiple
emails at the same time. Reasons for this are to make it quicker to handle, not
require a ton of bag space to fill an order, and to be able to rotate among
various users with requests to be fair.'

# 'houses' lists the houses and the contents for each house. If no "zones" field
# is present for an expansion, then all appropriate zones for that expansion are
# used. Zones are only needed if only part of the expansion is stored in a
# house. (E.g., In the example below, Rain of Fear is split between two houses
# and Periodic fits in the remainder of the second house and Call of the
# Forsaken is in a house by itself.)
